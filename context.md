we are working on a site redesign of goatinfosec.com
our main goal is executive front facing, more technical as you go deeper into the site
currently, were generating all of the services in the all services section, making an entire page for each of the services
Were looking at novel attack paths, reducing redundant content, get niche hacking scopes from defcon talk titles
after that, were going to put our cal link https://cal.com/goatsec where appropriate
finally, were going to do a small-medium business section where we do a simpler scaled down enterprise security experience, focusing on education
