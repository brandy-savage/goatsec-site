<!-- FAQ -->
<section class="section" id="faq">
 <div class="wrap">
 <div class="eyebrow">FAQ</div>
 <h2 class="h2">The questions procurement asks before they approve anything.</h2>
 <p class="lead" style="margin-bottom:40px">We've been through enough procurement processes to know what comes up. Here are the answers to the questions that usually slow things down so you can move faster.</p>

 <div class="g2" style="gap:16px">

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">Do you sign NDAs?</div>
 <p class="body">Yes, and we prefer to sign them before technical scoping conversations, not just before contract execution. We have our own mutual NDA template and will review yours if your organization requires a specific form. NDA execution typically takes one business day.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">What insurance do you carry?</div>
 <p class="body">We carry professional liability (errors and omissions) and cyber liability insurance. Certificates of insurance are available for your procurement process. If your organization requires specific coverage limits or additional insured status, ask us early so we can confirm what's available.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">What does the contracting process look like?</div>
 <p class="body">We work on a statement of work model. Every engagement begins with a scoped SOW that defines deliverables, timeline, acceptance criteria, and payment terms. We don't do open-ended time-and-materials engagements without a clearly scoped phase structure. Scope changes require a written amendment. No verbal change orders.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">How do you handle sensitive findings and data?</div>
 <p class="body">Findings and technical evidence are shared through encrypted channels, we don't send sensitive material over standard email. We don't retain client data after an engagement closes unless explicitly requested. Data handling expectations are written into the engagement SOW so both parties know what applies.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">What are your payment terms?</div>
 <p class="body">Standard terms are net 30. For assessment sprints, we typically invoice 50% at engagement kickoff and 50% on final deliverable acceptance. For retainers, we invoice monthly in advance. We accept ACH, wire transfer, and major credit cards. Procurement purchase orders are supported.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">Can GoatSec work with our existing security toolchain?</div>
 <p class="body">Yes. We're toolchain-agnostic and vendor-neutral. We work with whatever you have in place and evaluate gaps from there, we don't require you to adopt specific tools as a condition of working with us. If we recommend a tool, we'll tell you why and show you the alternatives we considered.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">Do you subcontract engagement work?</div>
 <p class="body">For staff augmentation, we introduce practitioners from our network who are placed directly with your organization. For GoatSec-run engagements, primary delivery work is done by GoatSec practitioners. If we bring in a specialist for a specific technical area a particular cloud platform or a specialized compliance framework we'll tell you in the SOW.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">What's your response time for active engagements?</div>
 <p class="body">For active engagements, you have a named point of contact, not a support queue. For urgent questions or blockers, same-day response. For standard questions and status updates, one business day. For retainer clients, we establish a communication rhythm during the kickoff week and adjust it to what actually works for your team.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">How far in advance do I need to book an engagement?</div>
 <p class="body">For assessment sprints, typically two to three weeks lead time for a standard start date. For integration sprints and retainers, two to four weeks depending on what's in the pipeline. If you have an urgent need a breach, an imminent audit, a time-sensitive vendor decision reach out directly and we'll tell you honestly what's possible.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">Do you have experience in regulated industries?</div>
 <p class="body">Yes. We've worked across fintech, healthcare, SaaS, and government-adjacent organizations environments with HIPAA, PCI DSS, SOC 2, FedRAMP, and NIST CSF compliance requirements. If your industry has specific regulatory obligations that affect how security work gets scoped or documented, tell us up front and we'll factor them in from the start.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">What happens if a deliverable doesn't meet expectations?</div>
 <p class="body">Every engagement SOW defines acceptance criteria for deliverables. If a deliverable doesn't meet the criteria we both agreed to, we revise it at no additional cost. We send a draft before final delivery specifically to catch misalignments before they become issues. We'd rather spend two extra days on a revision than hand off something that misses the mark.</p>
 </div>

 <div class="card">
 <div class="h4" style="margin-bottom:8px">Can I see references or speak with past clients?</div>
 <p class="body">Yes, with prior client permission. We can connect you with past clients in similar industries or engagement types who've agreed to serve as references. Reach out during your evaluation process and we'll facilitate introductions to the relevant connections in our network.</p>
