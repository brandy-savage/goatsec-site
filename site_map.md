# GoatSec CruiseCon Site Kit (Flow + Sitemap)

This kit is for a **CruiseCon CISO / Security Exec** audience (high intent, peer networked, time-constrained).
The homepage stays **high-level and confident**; deeper pages reveal **technical precision, deliverables, and artifacts**.

---

## Audience segment (CruiseCon CISO “typical”)

CruiseCon is positioned as a CISO/senior-security focused event with CISO panels and executive speakers. (See CruiseCon agenda & positioning.)  
Use-case: a CISO skims your site on mobile between sessions and needs to decide in <60 seconds if you're credible.

**Profile**
- Age: ~38–55
- Title mix: CISO / VP Security / Head of Security / Deputy CISO / GRC leader
- Environment: mid-market → enterprise; often regulated or high-breach-risk
- Buying reality: vendor sprawl + tool fatigue, limited headcount, constant board pressure
- Success criteria: measurable risk reduction, smoother audits, fewer escalations, faster projects
- What they hate: fluffy promises, unclear scope, “we do everything” with no proof

**Your wedge**
A **white-glove “Security Outcomes Desk”**:
- You *own the problem statement*, translate needs into scope, and run execution end-to-end.
- You *mediate vendors* (selection, negotiation, integration, enablement) and reduce tool waste.
- You provide *technical artifacts* security teams can actually use.

## Design principles (CruiseCon audience)
- Strong “enterprise confidence” (dark neutral, brass/gold accent, crisp spacing)
- Zero gimmicks (no neon, no hacker cosplay)
- Credibility signals above the fold:
  - who you serve
  - the outcomes you drive
  - what artifacts you deliver
  - simple engagement model
