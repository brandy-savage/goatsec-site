<!-- WHY DIFFERENT -->
<section class="section">
 <div class="wrap">
 <div class="split" style="gap:48px;align-items:start">
 <div>
 <div class="eyebrow">Why it's different</div>
 <h2 class="h2">A referral from someone who has worked alongside them.</h2>
 <p class="body" style="margin-bottom:16px">Most staffing processes work the same way: a recruiter screens résumés against a keyword list, passes candidates to you, and collects a fee when someone gets hired. The problem is that security talent is hard to evaluate on paper. A résumé that says "penetration testing" and "SIEM engineering" can mean almost anything.</p>
 <p class="body" style="margin-bottom:16px">Our network is built differently. Every practitioner we place is someone we've worked with on a real engagement, someone whose technical depth we've seen firsthand, whose judgment under pressure we've observed, and whose communication style we can vouch for. We're not placing strangers; we're extending our own reputation.</p>
 <p class="body" style="margin-bottom:24px">That means a GoatSec introduction comes with context you won't get from a staffing agency: what they're genuinely great at, where they work best, what environment suits their style, and what you should ask them in the interview to see their best work.</p>

 <div class="label" style="margin-bottom:10px">Contract to hire</div>
 <p class="small">If you want to evaluate someone before making a full-time offer, we can structure the engagement that way from the start. We're transparent about it with the practitioner, and it avoids the awkwardness of converting mid-engagement.</p>
