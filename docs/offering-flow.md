# Offering flow (site behavior)

Goal: “Marketing confidence up front” with “technical precision deeper”.

## Page pattern (use everywhere)
1) One-sentence outcome
2) When to use / when NOT to use
3) Timeline (typical)
4) What you get (deliverables & artifacts)
5) Inputs required (what you need from the client)
6) Success metrics (how we measure results)
7) Optional add-ons / integrations
8) Exec vs Technical section:
   - Executive summary (plain language)
   - Technical depth (methodology + artifacts)

## Core conversion paths
- Outcome buyer: Home → Packages → Book
- Proof seeker: Home → Proof → Offering → Book
- Tool fatigue: Home → Vendor Enablement → Integrations → Book
